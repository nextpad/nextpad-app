# The Open Launchpad

The Open Launchpad (TOL) is a community-driven platform where everything should be open and in plain sight. Launchpad integration - It enables the ability to create or self-list any contract as a launch pad and if approved by the community via voting, anyone can submit it. The platform enables the permissionless deployment of customizable launchpads, an easy-to-use token generation mechanism and secure lockers for storing these tokens with open and transparent community governance, over viewing all project updates progress. This allows users to directly participate in the development and decision-making of projects, creating a decentralized blockchain community.
